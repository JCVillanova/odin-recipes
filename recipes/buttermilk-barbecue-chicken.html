		<h1>Buttermilk Barbecue Chicken</h1>
		<img src='../img/buttermilk-barbecue-chicken.jpg' alt='two halves of a chicken on a platter garnished with lemon slices' width='400'>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Buttermilk is a very popular marinade for fried chicken, but for whatever reason, it isn't often used with other chicken cooking methods. Yogurt, a very similar product, is quite popular in grilled chicken marinades. So, why not use buttermilk? This goes great with coleslaw, potato salad, and a squeeze of lemon.</p>
		<p>It takes a total of 7 hours and 5 minutes to make, and, being a whole chickent, will serve six people!</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
			<li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
			<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
			<li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Whisk buttermilk, brown sugar, cider vinegar, garlic, thyme, pepper, paprika, cumin, cayenne, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
			<li>Trim wing flats from the chicken. Cut along both sides of the backbone from the tail to the neck; remove backbone. Make a 1/4-inch-deep cut through the piece of cartilage in the center. Open up both sides to reveal breastbone; lift out. Cut chicken in half through the center line.</li>
			<li>Place both halves in a resealable zip-top bag and pour in the buttermilk marinade. Place the bag in a bowl to catch any leaks. Press air out and seal. Marinate in the fridge for 6 to 18 hours.</li>
			<li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade and transfer onto a paper towel-lined plate. Blot off excess marinade.</li>
			<li>Place chicken on the grill cut-side down, skin-side up; cover and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>Flip chicken over and continue grilling for 7 to 10 minutes. Flip once more and grill until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165℉ (74℃).</li>
